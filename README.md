## 2. Code habit

**Structure** :
```
Part 1 - Global variables or test data input

Part 2 - Program Main-body functions
         Output usually here inside functions using console.log

Part 3 - Function calls(with some test data input)

//Comments and explanations will be added if I have enough boring time
```
**specific structure may various due to specific situation*

**Language** - Javascript, will add other languages the course would also include them;
